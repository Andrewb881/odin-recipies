    <h1>Candy Pizza</h1>
    <img src="candypizza.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This candy bar cookie pizza will use up some of that candy for you.  And trust me, it is way better than just eating the leftover Halloween candy by itself.  A gooey chocolate chip cookie that is topped with a mixture of melted chocolate and peanut butter.  Then you sprinkle on whatever your favorite candy is.</p>
